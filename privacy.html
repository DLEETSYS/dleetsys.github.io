    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This Service is provided by <strong>DLEETSYS AB</strong> at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

    <p>This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for anyone who decides to use our applications (the "Service").</p>

    <p>By using our Service, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy. DLEETSYS AB is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected and that you can use our applications with complete confidence.</p>

    <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
    <p><strong>DLEETSYS AB does not collect, save, or record any personal data.</strong> Our applications are designed to function without the need for any personally identifiable information. We do not maintain any databases, server-side storage, or user accounts.</p>

    <p>While our applications do not collect your data, they may be available through third-party platforms (such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store) which have their own independent privacy policies regarding the data they collect for app delivery and performance.</p>

    <h3>Log Data and Analytics</h3>
    <p>We want to inform you that <strong>we do not record any log data.</strong> Unlike many other services, our applications do not collect your device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, or any statistics regarding your usage. We do not track when or how you use the Service.</p>

    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>Our applications do not use cookies for tracking or data collection. Any third-party libraries used by the operating system for basic app functionality may use technical identifiers, but no personal data is shared with DLEETSYS AB through these processes.</p>

    <h3>Service Providers</h3>
    <p>We may occasionally utilize third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service or perform technical maintenance. Because DLEETSYS AB does not collect personal information, no such information is ever shared with or sold to third parties.</p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>We value your trust. Because we do not collect or store any data, your personal information is inherently secure from being compromised through our applications.</p>

    <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
    <p>Our applications may contain links to external websites. Note that these external sites are not operated by DLEETSYS AB. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

    <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
